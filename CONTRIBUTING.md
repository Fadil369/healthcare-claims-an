## Coding Guidelines

### General Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new features and components
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for React components, types, and interfaces
- Indentation: 2 spaces for JS/TS/TSX, 4 spaces for others
- Write clear, modular, testable code
- Add JSDoc/TSDoc comments to all functions and classes
- Never hardcode secretsâ€”use environment variables
- Organize code by domain and feature

### React/TypeScript Specific
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports over default exports for components
- Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use the useKV hook for persistent data storage
- Follow the existing component structure and patterns

### Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Follow the design system defined in index.css
- Use shadcn components when available
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility

### File Organization
- Components in `/src/components/`
- Utility functions in `/src/lib/`
- Context providers in `/src/contexts/`
- Types and interfaces in appropriate component files
- Assets in `/src/assets/` with proper subdirectories

### Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use proper loading states and user feedback
- Follow SOLID principles where applicable
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design

### Security Best Practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Use secure file upload practices
- Implement proper data sanitization
- Never expose sensitive data in client-side code
- Use environment variables for configuration
