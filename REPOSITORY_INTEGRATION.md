## GitHub Copilot Integration

### Domain Context Configuration

The `.copilot/settings.json` file provides Copilot with specialized knowledge about:

- **Healthcare Domain**: CCHI regulations, insurance workflows, medical terminology
- **Saudi Market**: Local insurance providers, Arabic language support, cultural considerations
- **Mobile-First Development**: Touch interfaces, responsive design, performance optimization
- **Security & Compliance**: Healthcare data privacy, HIPAA considerations, secure file processing

### Intelligent Code Suggestions

Copilot is configured to understand and suggest:

1. **Bilingual Components**: Automatic Arabic translations and RTL layout support
2. **Healthcare Workflows**: Insurance claim processing, rejection analysis, compliance checking
3. **Mobile Patterns**: Responsive grids, touch-friendly controls, progressive disclosure
4. **Saudi-Specific Logic**: CCHI compliance, local provider integrations, cultural adaptations

## Development Environment Setup

### Required Extensions

The `.vscode/extensions.json` file automatically suggests essential extensions:

- **GitHub Copilot & Copilot Chat**: AI-powered code assistance
- **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense**: Enhanced CSS class suggestions
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency
- **Prettier**: Automatic code formatting
- **TypeScript**: Enhanced TypeScript support

### VS Code Configuration

The workspace is pre-configured for:

- **Auto-formatting on save**: Consistent code style across the team
- **Tailwind CSS support**: Class name completion and validation
- **TypeScript optimization**: Enhanced IntelliSense and error reporting
- **Import management**: Automatic import organization and updates

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Testing

The GitHub Actions workflow tests:

- **Code Quality**: ESLint, TypeScript compilation, formatting checks
